The TwitterAnalysis class gathers some baseline data of twitter users intended to be used
for social analysis. The program takes in a twitter screen name or a user ID and returns 
some general information about when the user is active, what apps the user prefers to use
to tweet, number of friends and followers, and the top ten most popular words used. This 
program also allows for refreshing to gather real time updates from the user.

To run the program, run twitterAnalysis()
